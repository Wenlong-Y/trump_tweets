## Introduction

President is one of the branch in our government. The behavior of the
president and its impacts deserve great public attention. President
Trump use twitter as a major way to communicate with the public. I want
to find out more about Trump from his tweets. I also want to find out
public opinions on different issues based on public reactions to Trump’s
tweets.

The data was downloaded from a
[website](http://http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/data/realdonaldtrump/)
created by Brendan Brown. I extracted all of Trump’s tweets from 2009 to
Nov. 3rd 2019 as the total data. The size of the data is about 9 Mb.

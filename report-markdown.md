## Introduction

In this report, I analyzed the tweeting habit of Donald Trump and what
we can learn about the president from these tweets.

The data was downloaded from a
[website](http://http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/data/realdonaldtrump/)
created by Brendan Brown. I extracted all of Trump’s tweets from 2009 to
Nov. 3rd 2019 as the total data. The size of the data is about 9 Mb.

## The devices

First of all, let us take a look at the devices Trump use to send
tweets. We will look at the statistics for the whole time between 2009
to 2019.

Now, let us check the number of tweets by year.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
